BloomAPI
========

BloomAPI was originally this open source project. While BloomAPI is now a company with a different focus, this project is still actively maintained as set of libraries and executables to translate existing datasources into performant APIs. A public deployment of BloomAPI as well as more information can be found at https://www.bloomapi.com/documentation/public-data.

To get a locally running copy of BloomAPI (only prerequisite Docker with 4GB+ of memory):

1. Download https://raw.githubusercontent.com/untoldone/bloomapi/master/docker-compose.yml
2. Run `docker-compose up -d` from the same directory

Code is also available for the current publically hosted datasources at https://github.com/bloomapi/datasources. This includes the NPI, ICD9, ICD10, PECOS and others.

Today, BloomAPI is focused on simplifying the way medical data are shared through technical and non-technical means. For more information about BloomAPI, see https://www.bloomapi.com.
